Every programmer want to be excellent, so the problem is how to become a good programmer. To me, I will use node as my mainly
working language, so my topic is how to become a good node programmer. And I will find this answer in the coming years.

First of all, as basic user, you have to know these node.js libs to quickly construct the solution for your work, as I list
below:

servers:

[express]    -fast build for websites

[restify]    -API server

[koa] es6    -version server

tools:

[grunt]    -auto task runner of node

[underscore]    -object array utility

TDD:

[mocha]    -test framework for node

[jasmine-node]    -use the same concepts and settings of mocha

system help:

[fs-extra]    -expand methods the node core module 'fs'

[adm-zip]    -module to make zip, it is buggy

dbs:

[mysql]

[redis]

[levelDB]

...

application manager:

[pm2]    -manage node apps and provide performance profiling

[forever]    -simple node app starter

debug tool:

[node-inspector]    -not good enough node debugger

es6 compile tools:

[traceur]    -tool to provide es6 feature for your code, will be replace by the gradually support of es6
