<h3>Deploy mysql environment with docker</h3>
<p>Whenever move work space from one machine to another, it's annoying to move the database environment. If two machines
   can remote access the same database, it's OK. If it is not, we have to deploy and config the same database twice.
   However, with docker we can easily solve this problem.
